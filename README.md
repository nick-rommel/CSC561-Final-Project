# CSC561-Final-Project
Song Genre Classification using image classification on mel spectrograms.

This project employs transfer learning methodologies in order to use a pre-trained ViT and fine tune it on a much smaller, and also public, dataset.

## The Dataset

We used a modified version of the GTZAN dataset that already had its wav files converted into mel-spectrograms.

The dataset can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification).
